# Product Description

## Why This Project Exists

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a powerful approach for building complex software systems, but implementing DDD patterns consistently across a team can be challenging and time-consuming. Developers often spend significant time writing boilerplate code for entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services, which can lead to inconsistencies and reduced productivity.

mcp4ddd addresses this problem by providing an MCP server that automates the generation of DDD components, ensuring consistency and allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than repetitive scaffolding.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Inconsistent DDD Implementation**: Teams struggle to maintain consistent patterns across DDD components
2. **Time-Consuming Boilerplate**: Writing entity types, factory functions, and test files manually takes significant time
3. **Learning Curve**: New team members need to understand DDD patterns and how to implement them correctly
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: Keeping DDD components up-to-date with evolving patterns is difficult
5. **Type Safety**: Ensuring type-safe implementations of DDD patterns requires careful attention

## How It Should Work

The system operates as an MCP server that provides four main tools:

1. **Entity Generator**: Creates DDD entities with optional aggregate root designation
2. **Value Object Generator**: Generates immutable value objects with validation
3. **Repository Generator**: Creates repository interfaces for data persistence
4. **Domain Service Generator**: Generates domain services with dependency injection

Each tool:
- Accepts structured input via Zod schemas
- Uses Handlebars templates to generate TypeScript code
- Produces both implementation and test files
- Follows established DDD patterns and conventions

## User Experience Goals

### For Developers
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing MCP clients without complex setup
- **Intuitive Input**: Clear, well-documented parameters for each generation tool
- **Consistent Output**: Generated code follows consistent patterns and conventions
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **Test Coverage**: Automatic generation of comprehensive test files

### For Teams
- **Standardization**: Ensures all team members follow the same DDD patterns
- **Productivity**: Reduces time spent on boilerplate code by 70-80%
- **Quality**: Minimizes errors through automated, validated code generation
- **Maintainability**: Generated code is easy to understand and modify

### For Projects
- **Scalability**: Supports growing complexity as projects evolve
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different DDD implementation styles
- **Future-Proof**: Designed to accommodate planned enhancements like bounded contexts

## Success Metrics

- Developer productivity increases by reducing boilerplate coding time
- Code consistency improves across team members
- Type safety is maintained in all generated components
- Test coverage reaches 100% for generated code
- Integration with MCP clients is seamless and reliable
