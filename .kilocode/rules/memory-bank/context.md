# Context

## Current Work Focus
MCP server with bounded context support and DynamoDB repository generation fully implemented. Ready for production use.

## Recent Changes
- Bounded context support fully implemented
- All generators updated to accept boundedContext and layer parameters
- Path generation modified to use monorepo structure: packages/domainlogic/{boundedContext}/{layer}/src/domainmodel/
- DynamoDB repository generator implemented with ElectroDB integration
- Unit and integration tests updated and passing
- Memory bank fully initialized and verified

## Next Steps
- Consider additional bounded context features (e.g., cross-context communication patterns)
- Add support for other database implementations (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Implement domain event generation
