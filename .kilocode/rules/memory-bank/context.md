# Context

## Current Work Focus
Monorepo architecture fully implemented with three packages: scaffolder (MCP server), runtime (shared utilities), and testbed (experimentation environment). All packages building and tested successfully.

## Recent Changes
- **Major Refactoring**: Converted single package to monorepo with three packages
- **Package Separation**: Created @ddd-components/scaffolder, @ddd-components/runtime, and @ddd-components/testbed
- **Runtime Library**: Moved BasicErrorTypes, BasicModelTypes, DynamoDBConfig, and WorkflowStart to runtime package
- **Template Updates**: Updated .hbs templates to reference @ddd-components/runtime
- **Build System**: Updated pnpm workspace configuration and build scripts
- **Testbed Environment**: Created safe experimentation space with example prompts
- **DynamoDB Table Name**: Made the DynamoDB table name configurable via `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME` environment variable instead of hard-coded value, supporting single-table design
- **PostgreSQL Repository Generation**: Successfully generated PostgreSQL repository implementation for a sample aggregate in testbed bounded context using Objection.js
- All tests passing and packages building successfully

## Next Steps
- Test monorepo in production MCP client environments
- Consider additional bounded context features (e.g., cross-context communication patterns)
- PostgreSQL repository support implemented; consider MongoDB implementation
- Implement domain event generation
